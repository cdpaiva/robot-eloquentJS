## Robot - Eloquent JavaScript, chapter 7

Over-commented code of the project presented in Eloquent JS, [chapter 7](https://eloquentjavascript.net/07_robot.html).

The main file is `simulation.js` where the simulation of diferent robots can be run.

In the book's website there is a feature for generating a visual presentation of the robot simulation, which is far better than the bunch of console.logs you'll get in here.
